### Autocomplete:
You could use integrated option to add autocompletion to Ize commands (bash, fish, zsh, powershell). In this manual we will describe it only for zsh and bash.

To add autocompletion script, use the following manual:

##### 1. ZSH:
If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need to enable it. You should execute the following once:

```shell
echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >>  ~/.zshrc
```

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

###### 1.1 macOS:
```shell
ize completion zsh > /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_ize
```

###### 1.2 Linux:
You will need root privileges.

```shell
sudo zsh
```
Input your root password and run:

```shell
ize completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_ize"
```

To take effect for this setup you should run `source ~/.zshrc` or simply restart shell.


##### 2. Bash:
Autocompletion script depends on the `bash-completion` package.

If it is not installed already, you can install it via your OSâ€™s package manager.

To load completions for every new session, you should execute once:

###### 2.1 MacOS:
```shell
ize completion bash > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/ize
```

###### 2.2 Linux:
You will need root privileges.

```shell
sudo bash
```
Input your root password and run:

```shell
ize completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/ize
```

To take effect for this setup you should run `source ~/.bashrc` or simply restart shell.
