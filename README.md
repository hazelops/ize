# ❯ ize:
_Opinionated tool for infrastructure and code._ 

This tool is designed as a simple wrapper around popular tools, so they can be easily integrated in one infra: terraform, ECS deployment, serverless, and others.

It combines infra, build and deploy workflows in one and is too simple to be considered sophisticated. So let's not do it but rather embrace the simplicity and minimalism.

## Workflow
Let's imagine we're deploying a terraform-based infra and a Go-based  service named `goblin`.
The general workflow that **❯ize** dictates is the following:

### 1. Deploy infrastructure
_Currently it supports Terraform, for which it generates a minimal backend config for terraform and runs it. Think of it as a minimalistic Terragrunt, but you can always switch to a vanilla Terraform. Check out directory structure [examples](https://github.com/hazelops/ize/tree/main/examples/simple-monorepo/.infra)._
```shell
ize deploy infra
```

### 2. Push secrets for `goblin` to SSM
_It uses Go AWS SDK to push secrets to SSM_
```shell
ize secrets push goblin
ize secrets rm goblin
```

### 3. Build your `goblin` application
_It runs a docker build with all require underneath.
```shell
ize build goblin
```

### 4. Deploy your `goblin` application
_It runs a simple logic of updating your task definitions to a new version (and rolling back in case ELB/ALB fails). Currently [hazelops/ecs-deploy](https://github.com/hazelops/ecs-deploy) container is used._
```shell
ize deploy goblin
```

### 5. Bring up & Bring SSM tunnel
_If you use a bastion host, you can establish a tunnel to access your private resources, like Postgres or Redis. This feature is using Amazon SSM and SSH tunneling underneath. Simple, yet effective._
```shell
ize tunnel up
ize tunnel down
```


## Installation
### To install the latest version via homebrew on MacOS:
##### 1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
##### 2. Run the following commands:
```shell
brew tap hazelops/ize
```

```shell
brew install ize
```

### To install the latest version via public apt repository URL (Ubuntu):
##### 1. Add public apt repository run:
 ```shell
echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://apt.fury.io/hazelops/ /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/fury.list
```

##### 2. After this, you should update information about repos. Run:
```shell
sudo apt-get update
```

##### 3. To install the latest version of `ize` app, you should run:
```shell
sudo apt-get install ize 
```

##### 4. If you wish to install certain version of the `ize` you should add version like this:
 ```shell
sudo apt-get install ize=<version>
 ```

### Autocomplete:
#### MacOS & zsh:
Enable autocompletion 
```shell
echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >>  ~/.zshrc
```
Load autocompletion on every session
```shell
ize completion zsh > /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_ize
```
